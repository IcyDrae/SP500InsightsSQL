# SP500InsightsSQL

A financial analysis project for the S&P 500 using T-SQL.

## Description

The queries are used for three main purposes:

1. Historical Trends: Analyzing how the S&P 500 index has evolved over different time periods (years, months, etc.) by looking at average closing prices, highs, or lows.
2. Price Patterns: Studying highs and lows over time to recognize any patterns or cycles. For example, do certain months or years experience greater market peaks or troughs?
3. Correlations: Analyzing how one variable (like trading volume) is related to another (like price changes).

## Getting Started

1. In SQL Server Management Studio restore [the database backup file](./Database).
2. Run the queries.
